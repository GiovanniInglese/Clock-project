This Project is a simple project for my CS 230 class. The task at hand was to create an instance of a clock; however, it does not move in real-time. The clock can be set to whatever time you wish it to be, and it operates in 12-hour and 24-hour formats. It also tracks AM and PM times for the 12-hour time zones.  This project was for a mock company that wished to display its time to users not only in 12-hour time zones but in 24-hour time zones as well.   This is important for companies who wish to have a universal audience or people in other countries who operate with 24-hour time zones who need to operate within the companies time zones as well.

This project utilized the programming language of C++ and has taught me about creating various functions that can be used to manipulate strings, turn digits into strings for manipulations, as well ass how to format certain text styles of projects that you wish to create and add a bit of formatting to as well.
Creating this project aslo introduced me to utilizing header files and creating short and readable main files ot make the code simpler to analyze and easier to modify later in the future  The use of functions in the programs also makes it easier to manipulate or modify if there are chnages to be made which is an important aspect in the programming world.  Readability and adaptability are two imprtant aspects when it comes to the industry.  This was a small but educational project.
